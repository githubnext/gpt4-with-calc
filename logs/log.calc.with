# Guidance

Do not answer the question. Instead, write some calculations and comparisons relevant to answering the question. Do this by writing a code block with sections:
* Definitions
* Calculations* Comparisons

* Return

General guidance for all sections about labels:
* Use names like `car_count` or `speed_of_car_in_km_per_h` for each label.
* Document each label with a descriptive comment at end of line.


General guidance for all sections about units:
* Every label name should include the unit if known.
* End each definition with a semicolon.
* Include a unit at the end of the comment, like [billions_of_dollars], [metric_tons], [square meters], [apples] or [meetings/week].
* If the unit is unknown use [unknown].

General guidance for all sections about code:
* Do NOT use lambda expressions, loops, 'if/else', 'return', '=>' or function definitions.
* Avoid all date/time calculations. Reduce to whole days, hours, minutes and arbitrary seconds.
In the optional "Definitions" section:
* Define a label for each number in the question.
* Define labels using Javascript 'const'.
* This section can include valid Javascript single-dimensional arrays.
* Do not use or create multi-dimensional arrays.
* Omit this section completely if it contains no definitions.

In the optional "Calculations" section:
* Define additional relevant labels using Javascript 'const'.
* Define each label using an expression that references previously defined labels.
* Do NOT include the calculated values for labels in code or comments.
* Do NOT solve equations, simply write relevant calculations.
* Avoid new assumptions in this section. If you make an assumption document it.
* This section should be valid Javascript definitions.
* Omit this section completely if it contains no definitions.
* Use integer division when appropriate.
* Calculate rounding in code where appropriate.
* Use values for constants such as pi and e from the Javascript Math library. 

In the optional "Comparisons" section:
* Define additional labels relevant to the question using Javascript 'const' by comparing labels using comparison operators and functions and evaluating to single boolean values.
* Do NOT include the calculated true/false values for these labels.
* This section should be valid Javascript definitions.
* Omit this section completely if it contains no definitions.

In the "Return" section (always present):
* A single "return" statement that puts all the defined values from the Calculations and Comparisons sections into a single object
* Then "//Done" and a new line

# Guidance

Do not answer the question. Instead, write some calculations and comparisons relevant to answering the question. Do this by writing a code block with sections:
* Definitions
* Calculations* Comparisons

* Return

General guidance for all sections about labels:
* Use names like `car_count` or `speed_of_car_in_km_per_h` for each label.
* Document each label with a descriptive comment at end of line.


General guidance for all sections about units:
* Every label name should include the unit if known.
* End each definition with a semicolon.
* Include a unit at the end of the comment, like [billions_of_dollars], [metric_tons], [square meters], [apples] or [meetings/week].
* If the unit is unknown use [unknown].

General guidance for all sections about code:
* Do NOT use lambda expressions, loops, 'if/else', 'return', '=>' or function definitions.
* Avoid all date/time calculations. Reduce to whole days, hours, minutes and arbitrary seconds.
In the optional "Definitions" section:
* Define a label for each number in the question.
* Define labels using Javascript 'const'.
* This section can include valid Javascript single-dimensional arrays.
* Do not use or create multi-dimensional arrays.
* Omit this section completely if it contains no definitions.

In the optional "Calculations" section:
* Define additional relevant labels using Javascript 'const'.
* Define each label using an expression that references previously defined labels.
* Do NOT include the calculated values for labels in code or comments.
* Do NOT solve equations, simply write relevant calculations.
* Avoid new assumptions in this section. If you make an assumption document it.
* This section should be valid Javascript definitions.
* Omit this section completely if it contains no definitions.
* Use integer division when appropriate.
* Calculate rounding in code where appropriate.
* Use values for constants such as pi and e from the Javascript Math library. 

In the optional "Comparisons" section:
* Define additional labels relevant to the question using Javascript 'const' by comparing labels using comparison operators and functions and evaluating to single boolean values.
* Do NOT include the calculated true/false values for these labels.
* This section should be valid Javascript definitions.
* Omit this section completely if it contains no definitions.

In the "Return" section (always present):
* A single "return" statement that puts all the defined values from the Calculations and Comparisons sections into a single object

# Guidance

Do not answer the question. Instead, write some calculations and comparisons relevant to answering the question. Do this by writing a code block with sections:
* Definitions
* Calculations* Comparisons

* Return

General guidance for all sections about labels:
* Use names like `car_count` or `speed_of_car_in_km_per_h` for each label.
* Document each label with a descriptive comment at end of line.


General guidance for all sections about units:
* Every label name should include the unit if known.
* End each definition with a semicolon.
* Include a unit at the end of the comment, like [billions_of_dollars], [metric_tons], [square meters], [apples] or [meetings/week].
* If the unit is unknown use [unknown].

General guidance for all sections about code:
* Do NOT use lambda expressions, loops, 'if/else', 'return', '=>' or function definitions.
* Avoid all date/time calculations. Reduce to whole days, hours, minutes and arbitrary seconds.
In the optional "Definitions" section:
* Define a label for each number in the question.
* Define labels using Javascript 'const'.

* Do NOT include the calculated values for labels in code or comments.
* Do NOT solve equations, simply write relevant calculations.
* Avoid new assumptions in this section. If you make an assumption document it.
* This section should be valid Javascript definitions.
* Omit this section completely if it contains no definitions.
* Use integer division when appropriate.
* Calculate rounding in code where appropriate.
* Use values for constants such as pi and e from the Javascript Math library. 

In the optional "Comparisons" section:
* Define additional labels relevant to the question using Javascript 'const' by comparing labels using comparison operators and functions and evaluating to single boolean values.
* Do NOT include the calculated true/false values for these labels.
* This section should be valid Javascript definitions.
* Omit this section completely if it contains no definitions.

In the "Return" section (always present):
* A single "return" statement that puts all the defined values from the Calculations and Comparisons sections into a single object

* Every label name should include the unit if known.
* End each definition with a semicolon.
* Include a unit at the end of the comment, like [billions_of_dollars], [metric_tons], [square meters], [apples] or [meetings/week].
* If the unit is unknown use [unknown].

General guidance for all sections about code:
* Do NOT use lambda expressions, loops, 'if/else', 'return', '=>' or function definitions.
* Avoid all date/time calculations. Reduce to whole days, hours, minutes and arbitrary seconds.
In the optional "Definitions" section:
* Define a label for each number in the question.
* Define labels using Javascript 'const'.
* This section can include valid Javascript single-dimensional arrays.
* Do not use or create multi-dimensional arrays.
* Omit this section completely if it contains no definitions.

In the optional "Calculations" section:
* Define additional relevant labels using Javascript 'const'.
* Define each label using an expression that references previously defined labels.
* Do NOT include the calculated values for labels in code or comments.
* Do NOT solve equations, simply write relevant calculations.
* Avoid new assumptions in this section. If you make an assumption document it.
* This section should be valid Javascript definitions.
* Omit this section completely if it contains no definitions.
* Use integer division when appropriate.
* Calculate rounding in code where appropriate.
* Use values for constants such as pi and e from the Javascript Math library. 

In the optional "Comparisons" section:
* Define additional labels relevant to the question using Javascript 'const' by comparing labels using comparison operators and functions and evaluating to single boolean values.
* Do NOT include the calculated true/false values for these labels.
* This section should be valid Javascript definitions.
* Omit this section completely if it contains no definitions.

In the "Return" section (always present):
* A single "return" statement that puts all the defined values from the Calculations and Comparisons sections into a single object
* Then "//Done" and a new line

# Guidance

Do not answer the question. Instead, write some calculations and comparisons relevant to answering the question. Do this by writing a code block with sections:
* Definitions
* Calculations* Comparisons

* Return

General guidance for all sections about labels:
* Use names like `car_count` or `speed_of_car_in_km_per_h` for each label.
* Document each label with a descriptive comment at end of line.


General guidance for all sections about units:
* Every label name should include the unit if known.
* End each definition with a semicolon.
* Include a unit at the end of the comment, like [billions_of_dollars], [metric_tons], [square meters], [apples] or [meetings/week].
* If the unit is unknown use [unknown].

General guidance for all sections about code:
* Do NOT use lambda expressions, loops, 'if/else', 'return', '=>' or function definitions.
* Avoid all date/time calculations. Reduce to whole days, hours, minutes and arbitrary seconds.
In the optional "Definitions" section:
* Define a label for each number in the question.
* Define labels using Javascript 'const'.
* This section can include valid Javascript single-dimensional arrays.
* Do not use or create multi-dimensional arrays.
* Omit this section completely if it contains no definitions.

In the optional "Calculations" section:
* Define additional relevant labels using Javascript 'const'.
* Define each label using an expression that references previously defined labels.
* Do NOT include the calculated values for labels in code or comments.
* Do NOT solve equations, simply write relevant calculations.
* Avoid new assumptions in this section. If you make an assumption document it.
* This section should be valid Javascript definitions.
* Omit this section completely if it contains no definitions.
* Use integer division when appropriate.
* Calculate rounding in code where appropriate.
* Use values for constants such as pi and e from the Javascript Math library. 

In the optional "Comparisons" section:
* Define additional labels relevant to the question using Javascript 'const' by comparing labels using comparison operators and functions and evaluating to single boolean values.
* Do NOT include the calculated true/false values for these labels.
* This section should be valid Javascript definitions.
* Omit this section completely if it contains no definitions.

In the "Return" section (always present):
* A single "return" statement that puts all the defined values from the Calculations and Comparisons sections into a single object
* Then "//Done" and a new line

* Document each label with a descriptive comment at end of line.


General guidance for all sections about units:
* Every label name should include the unit if known.
* End each definition with a semicolon.
* Include a unit at the end of the comment, like [billions_of_dollars], [metric_tons], [square meters], [apples] or [meetings/week].
* If the unit is unknown use [unknown].

General guidance for all sections about code:
* Do NOT use lambda expressions, loops, 'if/else', 'return', '=>' or function definitions.
* Avoid all date/time calculations. Reduce to whole days, hours, minutes and arbitrary seconds.
In the optional "Definitions" section:
* Define a label for each number in the question.
* Define labels using Javascript 'const'.
* This section can include valid Javascript single-dimensional arrays.
* Do not use or create multi-dimensional arrays.
* Omit this section completely if it contains no definitions.

In the optional "Calculations" section:
* Define additional relevant labels using Javascript 'const'.
* Define each label using an expression that references previously defined labels.
* Do NOT include the calculated values for labels in code or comments.
* Do NOT solve equations, simply write relevant calculations.
* Avoid new assumptions in this section. If you make an assumption document it.
* This section should be valid Javascript definitions.
* Omit this section completely if it contains no definitions.
* Use integer division when appropriate.
* Calculate rounding in code where appropriate.
* Use values for constants such as pi and e from the Javascript Math library. 

In the optional "Comparisons" section:
* Define additional labels relevant to the question using Javascript 'const' by comparing labels using comparison operators and functions and evaluating to single boolean values.
* Do NOT include the calculated true/false values for these labels.
* This section should be valid Javascript definitions.
* Omit this section completely if it contains no definitions.

In the "Return" section (always present):
* A single "return" statement that puts all the defined values from the Calculations and Comparisons sections into a single object
* Then "//Done" and a new line 


# Question

Suppose you buy 100 shares of XYZ stock for $50 per share. One year later, you sell all 100 shares for $60 per share. During the year, you also received $200 in dividends from the stock. What is the rate of return on this stock, as a percentage?

### Text of question

A mortgage of £300,000 is taken out over 15 years at an interest rate of 4.5% with monthly repayments. Of the first 12 repayments, how much in total goes to paying interest (rather than principal), to the nearest £100?

Suppose a firm has Cost of equity 8.5%, Equity $1,983,800, Cost of debt 4.2% and Debt $100,422 and corporate tax rate of 30%. What is the firm's WACC? Give answer as a percentage to one decimal place.

### Calculations


// Definitions
const cost_of_equity = 0.085; // Cost of equity as a decimal
const equity = 1983800; // Equity in dollars
const cost_of_debt = 0.042; // Cost of debt as a decimal
const debt = 100422; // Debt in dollars
const tax_rate = 0.3; // Corporate tax rate as a decimal

// Calculations
const total_value = equity + debt; // Total value of the firm in dollars
const equity_weight = equity / total_value; // Weight of equity in the capital structure as a decimal
const debt_weight = debt / total_value; // Weight of debt in the capital structure as a decimal
const after_tax_cost_of_debt = cost_of_debt * (1 - tax_rate); // After-tax cost of debt as a decimal
const wacc = equity_weight * cost_of_equity + debt_weight * after_tax_cost_of_debt; // Weighted average cost of capital as a decimal
const wacc_percentage = wacc * 100; // Weighted average cost of capital as a percentage
const wacc_rounded = Math.round(wacc_percentage * 10) / 10; // Weighted average cost of capital rounded to one decimal place

// Return
return {
